# NFT - NON FUNGIBLE TOKEN

 “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. NFT use the same technology as crypto-currency which is Blockchain.

 NFT is a blockchain which store extra information that make them work differently.NFT can be anything digital such as drawing ,music , your brain data. Thats why NFT also called digital assets.
